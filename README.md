Universal BLE

Universal BLE is an open-source developer tool for exploring and testing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. It empowers developers, engineers, and hobbyists to discover, connect, and debug BLE devices with a consistent cross-platform experience.

Built on the universal_ble Flutter plugin (https://pub.dev/packages/universal_ble) — one of the most comprehensive cross-platform BLE solutions available.

Key Features

Device Discovery

  Real-time scanning — Discover nearby BLE devices with live results; scanning continues when you open a device's detail screen
  Flexible filters — Filter by service UUIDs, name prefix, or manufacturer data (comma- or newline-separated)
  Saved filter presets — Save, rename, and reuse filter combinations; filters persist across app sessions
  Search — Search devices by name or by company name (resolved from manufacturer data via Bluetooth company identifiers)
  Sort options — Sort the device list by RSSI, last seen, or name
  Company identification — Show company name from manufacturer data using the Bluetooth SIG company identifier list
  RSSI and advertisements — View signal strength (RSSI), last advertisement (name, RSSI, timestamp), and a list of received ads that flashes on new advertisements
  System devices — On supported platforms, view and connect to devices already connected at the system level (with optional service filter)

Connection Management

  Connect and disconnect — Connect to and disconnect from BLE peripherals with one tap
  Auto-reconnect — Optional auto-connect for reconnection when a device becomes available again
  Connection state — Real-time connection state updates
  Multiple connections — Support for multiple simultaneous device connections

Service & Characteristic Exploration

  GATT discovery — Discover all services and characteristics on connected devices with detailed, human-readable formatting
  Favorite services — Mark services as favorites; they appear first in the list (system services last)
  Property filters — Filter characteristics by property (read, write, notify, indicate, etc.) with visual filter chips
  Navigation — Previous/next buttons to move between characteristics without collapsing the list
  Copy services — Copy the full discovered GATT layout (e.g. for documentation or debugging) from the Services panel header

Data Operations

  Read — Read characteristic values on demand
  Write — Write data to characteristics (with or without response)
  Subscribe — Subscribe to notifications/indications per characteristic or "subscribe to all" for notifiable characteristics
  Live updates — Incoming values are shown in the logs with timestamps; clear or copy the full log

Pairing & Security

  Pair and unpair — Initiate pairing and unpair devices when supported
  Pairing state — Monitor pairing state changes in real time

Advanced & Developer Options

  MTU — Request a larger MTU (e.g. 247) for better throughput where supported
  Command queue — Choose queue type in the drawer: Global (single queue), Per Device, or None (parallel)
  Configurable timeout — Set operation timeout (e.g. 10 seconds) for all BLE operations
  Logs — Operation log with copy-all and per-entry clear; comprehensive error handling with detailed codes
  UUID formats — Accepts common UUID string formats (e.g. with or without hyphens)

UI & Cross-Platform

  Responsive layout — Adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop (e.g. breakpoints at 600px and 1000px)
  Bluetooth status — Bluetooth availability icon with tooltip (tap on mobile to see state)
  Permissions — Guided permission flow where required (e.g. location for BLE on Android); re-checks on app resume
  Cross-platform — Built with the universal_ble plugin for consistent behavior across supported platforms


Perfect For

  Developers building BLE-enabled applications
  Engineers testing and debugging BLE devices
  Hobbyists exploring IoT and smart device capabilities
  Students learning about Bluetooth Low Energy technology
  QA teams validating BLE device functionality
